"Agree with Dennis Brown, though I don't think waiting a bit would change my opinion. The populist politics are concerning, but not all that trouble me about this candidate. I like to see significant content contributions from admins. Some like to see FAs or GAs. I personally think FA/GA can be more about proper formatting rather than writing a comprehensive encyclopedia article, but it usually shows how one responds to criticism. FA/GA at RfA ''should'' be about two things: showing that actual writing of the encyclopedia is a top priority and showing collaboration with other users. The FA/GAs appear to have been written out of a desire to pass RfA (and subsequent Arbcom). Further, they were written entirely by Lord Roem and show no collaboration with others. The topics were simply not interesting enough for anyone else to even start a stub on the topic.[http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Taylor_v._Illinois] In [[Taylor v. Illinois]], there are 3 listed references plus the primary source opinion/judgement/ruling/whatever. One of the references (Stocker) is used only once, one (Atkinson) is used 12 times, and the third (Heiderscheit) is used 5 times. Basically, this ""good"" article is based on one source. But there are so many <nowiki><ref></nowiki> tags thrown in there it appears as if the article is well sourced. This isn't to say the article is not needed on Wikipedia, but it does show that you are more interested in ticking off the boxes needed to make a Good Article rather than writing a good article.

Unfortunately, although TParis is being quite lenient, this answer and orientation is not acceptable at all. The first and foremost step is to engage the user in discussions. If a 3RR has been breached, even then extreme care has to be taken to engage the editor first or to confirm whether the editor has been substantially warned. Additionally, if Theo himself has initiated editing the said article and has started reverting deleted content, there is no definite guarantee that Theo is not seen as being involved by outside parties. In other words; consequently, his act of blocking the editor ''might'' be seen as being an involved act. Despite my strong wordings here, the fact is that I am neutral and not at all negative to his adminship, with due respect to Theo for standing up to the RfA again.

This is much harder to do that one would imagine if one does not have experience actually looking.  It's necessary to remove content  that is unsourced negative allegations about living persons, but even here if it quickly sourceable, that's even better. The difference is that if it is not quickly sourceable, instead of leaving it for someone else to source, we remove it. We need admins who know the difference, and it's a matter of practice as much as policy.The over-rigid application of BLP policy is frequent a cause of biased writing as the over-lax interpretation of it.  The need for sourcing is one of the reasons we should require significant article writing experience in admins--so they will know in practice how to find sources.  The justifications given here for removing content  leave me with the feeling that the candidate is coming here with a cause to bring about his own interpretation of policy, and  intends to try to shift consensus.

We need admins, but we need admins who communicate, and that is especially true when you get rid of goodfaith contributions (apologies if that communication took place on some other page) ''",0.21388888888888888,0.5953703703703703

Clearly an article should not be deleted if the subject is in fact notable, but the standard for deletion under criteria A7 is ""claim of importance"" not ""claim of notability"", a much lower threshold that an article must pass to survive. Response 7-3 highlights this problem, [[Wikipedia:Run-of-the-mill]] and [[WP:CRIME]] are fine arguments to make at the [[WP:AFD]] stage, but they really have no place in the consideration of a [[WP:CSD A7]].

As far as I can see the candidate has done no such work. If the candidate has no experience he is unsuitable at this stage. Although the downside risk might be low, I see no reason to risk pages being protected (or not) and editors being blocked (or not) because the candidate does not have sufficient grasp of relevant policy. They have no experience gained through performing a few simple but important janitorial tasks during the many years they have been here and especially in the period prior to RFA.

While I can see where you're coming from, I think it unfair to consider all teens as a stereotype. This is especially true when we have some perfectly decent admins who are teenagers, who have never caused any problems, and at the same time we have some horrendously immature adults. I know that many people are of the same opinion as you, but like with RFA questions, I feel that you have sometimes become a bit of a broken record at RFA talk, not normally adding anything new, except another attack at teenagers with no real purpose. We are usually short of good admin candidates, and discussion about how teenagers are all emotional, immature and incapable aren't exactly welcoming for good teenage candidates (which there almost certainly are out there).""

I believe SarekOfVulcan could have responded more appropriately in the first instance - even without answering the question.--<small><b><i>Club[[User_talk:ClubOranje|<font color=""darkorange"">Oranje</font>]]</i></b><sup>",0.11428571428571428,0.5107142857142857

In my past interactions with him, which I remember him because of that username of his, I've found him at different times to be an annoyingly doctrinaire deletionist, a reasonable guy who admits his errors and goes out of his way to be civil, and even an inexplicably impassioned defender of inclusion (this was at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Masonic buildings]]). Although my personal interactions with him have been civil, it's clear that this is not everyone's experience –  it seems that Snottywong has a temper.  I'm concerned by his expressed hostility to the ARS and his filing of that RfC for Colonel Warden. As others have said, that behavior suggests a lack of maturity. I have experienced some hard-nosed deletionism on his part (for example, when we interacted at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Heartland Baptist Bible College]], he declared that the article should be deleted as an ""unaccredited school which cannot grant academic degrees"", leading me to wonder if he thinks that Wikipedia articles are supposed to be certificates of legitimacy, kind of like the [[Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval]]).  Seeing his deletionism, I looked at his article-edit count, because I think that people who delete articles ought to have sufficient article-building experience to give them empathy with the people who have put their hearts into article development. His low article-space edit count doesn't give me confidence that he has that empathy.

"I was hoping to see some recent examples of this editor interacting with other administrators in order to review how his approach to handling disputes has changed since his early arbitrations.  Unfortunately, this editor has very few recent contributions in the Wikipedia and Wikipedia talk namespaces beyond extensive participation in AfD (and the odd RfA).  I skimmed back to the beginning of October.  (Namespace contributions: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=250&contribs=user&target=Everyking&namespace=4 Wikipedia], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=50&contribs=user&target=Everyking&namespace=5 Wikipedia talk].)  While he states an interest in blocking vandals, I see no contributions in the last year to WP:AIV.  I ''was'' worried by comments like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2009/Candidate_statements/Coren/Questions_for_the_candidate&diff=prev&oldid=330018304 this] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Motions&diff=prev&oldid=318291968 this].  Everyking seems to ''still'' believe that the restrictions imposed on his conduct were some sort of political persecution, and not a reflection of the persistent, disruptive, unfortunate damage his conflict with another editor was causing.  In his response to question 3 he talks about the lessons he's learned, but his comments since his last RfA (and since his subsequent attempt to have the ArbCom reinstate him without an RfA) don't seem to reflect this.",-0.14677777777777778,0.3447777777777778

I come to this view largely because of my one ""run-in"" with the candidate, which was at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Canbourne University (2nd nomination)]], an AfD started by Floquenbeam that I personally found annoying. At the time, I feared that Floqenbeam was going to turn out to be a smug holier-than-thou deletionist who has little empathy for the challenges faced by contributors who build and maintain articles. I am pleased to discover that I was wrong -- it seems this is one of just a couple of AfDs he ever initiated and one of only a very few that he ever participated in. Furthermore, he says he's not interested in doing XfDs. I think, however, that it is beneficial for administrators to have some experience in content creation -- in order to have some empathy for the concerns of contributors who research topics and write prose, and it appears to me that Floquenbeam lacks that kind of experience. The experience that his nominator describes as ""content creation"" is more along the lines of ""article cleanup.""

"'''Neutral''' for now, when having a look at this my reading of Sphilbrick's comments in the CRU controversy talk archives was pretty favourable, but the response above to question 5 led me to the answer ""The CC evidence page has a lot of unpleasant reading, but I see at least 749 diffs, and I don't think a single diff of mine made the list."" That suggests no involvement, but rather to my surprise [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Climate change/Evidence#Evidence presented by Sphilbrick]] is there, and is a bit disappointing. Sphilbrick's ""a few examples of word choices which should not, in general, be directed at editors"" starts with a diff of my use of a word which wasn't directed at an editor. Maybe Sphilbrick feels we should avoid the usage altogether, but in the circumstances more care should have been taken about introducing the evidence. Not really a big deal, but gives me some doubts.<br>On a different topic, the answer to question 9 opens up some questions. Perhaps it should be taken as read that before issuing warnings for edit warring, the first thing to do is check each editor's talk page and talk page history for previous warnings, as well as checking the edit history of the article concerned to confirm that there had been edit warring. There's an unstated presumption that the answer is from an uninvolved admin dealing with this situation, in which case ""I'll try to note in the warning that I separately plan to determine which version should be displayed while we work out the issue, and neither editor should take it upon themselves to unilaterally decide which is the right version."" is a bit odd as it suggests becoming an involved editor rather that an uninvolved admin, and the warning will require editors to stop all unilateral action anyway. While it's a good point made in the answer that libelous or attack material should be removed until issues with it are resolved, my understanding is that in general page protections are always of the Wrong Version, and 3RR is no respecter of being right or wrong, subject to any valid BLP exemption or evidence of sockpuppetry which should be considered before the warning. If there was a clear BLP violation the editor should be warned for that rather than just for edit warring, so the proposed note in the warning would be inappropriate, and if there wasn't then the first priority would be to remind editors to take the issues to talk rather than edit warring. Just my take on that answer. . .",-0.03888888888888889,0.49206349206349204

"'''Neutral''' - I think this RfA probably is premature, but I don't think it would be a serious mistake to give Sphilbrick the mop. Sphilbrick is a good photographer, a solid contributor, and pleasant and helpful person to interact with. His patience and consistency at [[WP:Requests for feedback]] are admirable. However, one of the best indications that a person is ready for adminship is a record of ""acting like an administrator"" for some period of time before the RfA, and I don't get that feeling with Sphilbrick. A year ago, we interacted on a couple of AfDs in which his comments seemed naive and newbyish, but that was a year ago. His recent involvement with MfD shows a commitment to helping with admin-type tasks, but even his most recent comments there ([[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Lehla/userpage]], [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Geo Swan/Guantanamo/Brook DeWalt]], [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Activist]]) fail to give me a sense of a person who confidently addresses questions from the context of Wikipedia policy. Several of his answers to questions above give me a sense of someone who hadn't thought very hard about the role/perspective of an administrator before beginning this RfA. I'm also bothered a bit by some of his input in climate change discussions. <br />It appears to me that this RfA is functioning as a learning experience for him, so if he is given the mop at the conclusion of the RfA, he will know what to do with it. Also, his cautious approach to his work as a contributor gives confidence that he will be cautious as an admin -- and won't jump in the middle of matters he doesn't understand. --",0.12475490196078433,0.4159313725490195
"'''Neutral''' for now. Question 6: ""Two editors have repeatedly inserted a claim that the subject has been unethical in his work, sourced to a well-known blog. ...

Answer: ""All parties should be warned about edit-warring. Either report them to WP:AN3 or confirm that they have been reported."" Not happy with that answer. Citing a self-published source's negative claims about a living person is ''as clear a BLP violation as they come''. The editor who has reverted the material out 7 times under the BLP exemption should be commended and backed up, not reported to AN3, and advised that they can take more effective steps the next time a similar situation occurs (e.g. post to ANI, rather than edit-warring). Editors adding the BLP violation should be warned. The admin adding the BLP violation needs to go to ANI.

An admin may actually block a user who has not been warned for many reasons, such as: socks of banned users, persistent vandals, or other LTA users; vandalbots or unapproved bots; users making death threats or outing other users; open proxies, obviously compromised accounts or accounts of confirmed-to-be-deceased users; and grossly inappropriate usernames (""User:Block me please, I'm a vandal!"" or ""User:Go fuck yourself, wikibitches""). And 3RR does not apply to BLP violations, which my example clearly was. Of course, the blocking admin was probably acting with the intent of stopping the disruption, but that doesn't make his actions right, and you should have every right to enforce the BLP policy. <span style=""font-family:Georgia;font-size:80%;"">'''/",0.040109890109890106,0.37728937728937734

You seem like a very conscientious editor, dedicated to improving the project. But looking at your contribs for the last 3-4 months, I get a somewhat strange impression. You say in answering Q1 that one of your intended areas of admin work is CSD. Yet, looking back to March, I saw maybe one or two CSD taggings that you did yourself (well, to be more accurate: I am not an admin so I can't see your deleted contributions record. But I only saw one or two author notifications about CSD tags that you did during that time).  Speedy deletion is a high precision area where pretty solid understanding of CSD criteria is needed by the admin reviewing a CSD tag, and I would really like to see some significant positive evidence that you understand them well. Regarding images and files. That is definitely an area where additional admins are very much needed. However, again looking at your contrib record for the last three months, I don't see a whole lot of activity on your part in files for deletion discussions, PUF discussions etc (most of what I have seen are ""delete, per nom"" brief !votes). In particular, I would have really like to see more instances where you yourself listed files for deletion or at PUF of CSD tagged them. I found very few such examples, the latest occurring in very early May. In fact, one of these examples worries me a bit. First you tagged an image as speedy with a pretty strange justification[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Wtc2.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=359391576], which clearly did not correspond to any of the CSD criteria. Of course, the speedy was declined. You then listed the same file for deletion. That particular discussion was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_deletion/2010_May_2#File:Wtc2.jpg closed as ""keep""]. I looked at the image, File:Wtc2.jpg, rather closely, and I still don't understand why you thought that the image was obtained by joining two images, ""of which its copyright status is unknown"". You certainly did not provide any justification for that in the discussion. I normally would not concentrate on an episode from that far back, but that was, it would appear, your second to last files for deletion nomination to date (the last one occurred on the same day, May 2).

Any RfA is based, as X! says, around the question ""do you trust this user as an admin?"", and the answer has to be ""no"". Why? Because an admin has to listen to the community. Because an admin has to be able to accept when he's wrong, or when his opinions on a block, or delete, or article protection, are different from those of everyone else in the room.

"'''Opose'''. I too think that you have done a lot of good work for the project, and vandal-fighting ''is'' important. However, there are a number of concerns that have been mentioned above. I disagree with your adminship analogy, likening it to being a school janitor. I would probably trust you with the ""cleaning"" part (eg. deleting articles that say ""I like pie!!!!!! lulz"") and perhaps a bit of ""security work (eg. blocking blatant and persistent vandalism-only accounts), but there is more to the role than that. I presume you wouldn't expect your janitor to put students in [[School punishment#Detention|detention]] or suspend them, or to decide when they can come back to school, or to fire teachers or to go through students' work and get rid of some of it. To move away from the analogy, adminship is a bit more complicated (blocking and protecting during content disputes for example). Content work is important not just for the sake of it, not just to show that you care about the project, but because it helps to show that you understand policies & guidelines and that you can work effectively with editors you disagree with.

I suppose that if you give third opinions regularly you wind up commenting on a very large number of disputes, which may make things difficult to follow; the more disputes you take an interest in, the less time you have to focus on each one of them.

"I concur with the Soap's sentiment right above me, as I do with the logged-out JC in the neutral section. At the end of the day, WS has his heart in the right place and I see no reason why he couldn't make a fine admin with guidance from those more experienced in the role. The risk of him deliberately abusing the tools is nil. The risk of negligent use is absolutely minimal and he wants to work in areas which are short of admins and where he has already done brilliant work. He has already made a dramatic turnaround from a myspacer to a prolific content writer and I see no reason why that tranformation would not continue, producing an even better editor and administrator. Quite frankly, if he'd retired the Coldplay Expert account and started the White Shadows account as a new one, although not strictly legit, the connection would be near unrecognisable and this RfA would almost certainly be going the other way.",0.21649477973007383,0.46896485867074095

"If I'm perfectly honest, I'm extremely surprised to see this nomination. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the name in the RfA TOC, but Wehwalt's signature is reassuring. With that said, as someone who has (maybe?) helped him get his bearings, it seems like just yesterday WS spent much of his time engaging in highly unnecessary disputes with respected users or unnecessary chatter on his talk page. He has made one of the most spectacular turnarounds I've ever seen in my three years on Wikipedia, but yet I feel he needs several more months to detach himself from his checkered past. I have no reason to believe he would deliberately misuse the admin bit, nor do I believe he would accidentally induce mayhem, but I don't yet think of WS as ""admin material"", however vague that may be. My advice would be to continue to establish yourself as a solid article creator. I'm well aware that one can literally change his ways in an instant, but in a community like ours, where every last mistake and quarrel is forever etched into multiple historical records, a consistent track record is necessary to pass RfA. On a more down-to-earth level, I agree that you need to work on sounding more professional in your talk page comments. ""Your"" and ""you're"" are not interchangeable, for example.

You answered part of ""why"" on the first part (why is BLP exempt from 3RR) but only answered ""what"" on the second part (NOR, NPOV, etc, can be taken to talk.  Why?)  But that aside, the answer bothers me that you are being too literal on BLP.  BLP, if anything, should be broadly interpreted (see [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Footnoted_quotes/Proposed_decision#Special_enforcement_on_biographies_of_living_persons|special enforcement]]).  If, for example, you are considering a 3RR complaint where one user has reverted a sourced, but tangential rant about a person (ie, Bob was a member of organization X in college last year.  Organization X's leader was convicted of a crime last year.  Here are 37 other things organization X has done over the years), that doesn't fall under ""libellous, biased, unsourced, or poorly sourced controversial material"" (because we're presupposing that every individual statement in there is sourced) but it darn well should be removed and no wikilawyering should result in it being a part of the article. [[Wikipedia:Coatrack]] is a good read.  The point is, we should err far on the side of protecting BLPs.  That's where IAR comes in.

"This isn't really a ""vote"", more of a discussion contribution.  But there's no section for that.<p>As always, my 3 AFD discussions question was a complex test.  It doesn't reveal any such problems as alluded to by [[User:Stifle|Stifle]] above (Any pointers to specific discussions of concern, Stifle?), but it does suggest a need for a pointer from experience.  Therefore I offer this advice:  Maunus, if you get administrator tools, as seems likely at this point, remember that ''you're still an editor as well''.  Ignore what NVO implies above; it's not true.  &#9786;  As administrators we still have editor hats, and we still have all of the tools that editors have.  Sometimes the right response is to ''just be an editor''.  Sometimes it's an ordinary editor tool that is the right tool for the job.  Your responses to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lebanese language]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Trifectant]] indicate that you automatically view your r&ocirc;le as being the closing administrator.  (Note that I worded the question quite carefully.  The discussions weren't chosen completely at random, either.  &#9786;)  Whilst that's admirable enthusiasm for a new administrator, from your responses to the question it is clear that the right courses of action, that would have helped AFD and Wikipedia ''more'', would have been for you to ''chime in as an ordinary editor'' and add your opinions to the discussions.  [[User:Timmeh|Timmeh]]  seems to have the same concern, that you are perhaps ''too'' willing to always wear an administrator hat.  You clearly have views on the articles in question (""like a clear deletion-candidate judging from the lack of sources and notability"" and ""The article is basically a POV fork from Libanese Arabic"") and those views would actually help the next person to come along, and any future discussion closer, ''more'' than just a mere re-listing would have.  (You do, after all, claim some knowledge of the field in the case of one of those discussions.)<p>So here's a tip based upon experience:  Remember that we can often help AFD and other processes by just being ordinary editors.  We aren't forced always to be discussion closers and arbiters.  The administrator tools are not the only tools in our toolboxes; and it's sometimes a far more useful and productive contribution to a discussion to ''edit'', to ''write'', and to ''find, read, and evaluate sources'', than to simply be a person wielding a rubber stamp.  You'll find that those are useful principles to remember outside of deletion discussions as well.",0.05108766233766234,0.42422077922077917

I have spent the last few months talking to Peter almost everyday. He has taught me so many different things about adminship and editing, not once loosing his patience. He never once gloated about what happened, and with every opportunity he had, he set the record straight and owned up to his actions no matter who questioned them. This is definitely one of the most powerful attributes an admin can have; admitting when you were wrong. Before he resigned his bit (disallowing any form of drama) he was an honest, responsible, and knowledgeable admin and I believe he will continue to be.

"Thank you for your willingness to do the hard work, but I feel you are not ready yet. For me, it is important how we address newbies, and the {{al|Nutkani}} CSD is a case in point: If you had checked ""What links here"", you would have easily seen the context and added it yourself, instead of proposing it for speedy deletion. Let me explain why this important for me: We have a systemic bias here; we have articles for many hardly notable people in the Western world, but lack articles about whole peoples elsewhere. Therefore, I feel that we need to spend more time helping particularly those editors, for whom contributing is often harder than for us. (A nice example for what I mean was [[The Village Market]], which was speedily deleted earlier this year, and I only became aware of it when the creator [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&oldid=275053311#Help_With_Deletion asked] about it at WP:HD.) So, I would have liked to see you help the newbie, instead of just templating {{genderneutral|em}}. In this context, it is also relevant that, as JamieS93 pointed out, some of the articles you cite as examples for your own creations were hardly above that level.

I expect admins to be smarter and more fair than the rest of us. If I go to an admin with a question, i expect them to know the answer or find one in short order. BoP strikes me as the sort who could do this, but if the clubhouse doesn't want him in the club, there ain't much we can say to change it. -",0.0662962962962963,0.543068783068783

When [[Hell's Gate National Park]] was erroneously passed as GA, I commented on the talk page with my concerns and received no reply from them.  Then, when the same article was taken to GAR in January of this year, still in very poor shape, Ceranthor stated that they ""kind of pass[ed] the article in AGF.

Tagging a page with ""hello"" as G1 instead of G2 seems like a trivial mistake but to a newbie contributor there is a difference whether their edits are called ""patent nonsense"" or simply ""test edits"". The former is far more bitey. Combine this with really basic errors when applying A1 (do you really think ""Emfada is an Irish Music Pop Artist"" or ""Nightlife is one of sick city's albums"" is not enough context to identify the subject?) The argument, that they were deleted and as such tagging was correct is flawed. Two of those A1 mistakes were deleted as A1 by admins who apparently don't know what A1 is for either. The candidate's otherwise good contributions stop me from opposing over those mistakes but I would ''really'' advise them to seek mentorship from an admin experienced in that area if this request is successful (i.e. have that admin check their deletions to avoid mistakes).

"I've had a hell of a lot of interaction with Mythdon since he began editing Wikipedia, and as he states, the Power Rangers subject area.

Recently, Mythdon had taken to sending articles to AFD for reasons that I've never found in any way part of the deletion reasons or processes. Until recently, any sort of article that should have probably been merged (at least in accordance with present practices concerning articles on fictional concepts). It was only until one of my comments towards him (which I now regret for how I handled myself) did all of our behaviors and practices were brought to light. I've not figured out why he acts as he does, but as far as I can tell, the only administrative function he should be allowed is the rollback function, as I do not trust his judgement if it comes to blocks, deletions, or protections. As per my (as it feels) daily interactions with this user, he is extremely difficult to talk to, difficult to reason with, and difficult to edit with. If you read [[Talk:Power_Rangers:_Jungle_Fury#Archive_soon_needed|this conversation]], you can see how he does not know when to stop. As far as I know, there have only been two pages that he's actually created, and afterwards he did not add to the pages, they were simply created.

I have seen Neuro's name around a lot lately and have generally had a positive impression of him &mdash; he is always willing to assume good faith when there isn't especially strong evidence of bad faith, and he admits and learns from his past mistakes. He is very active in a lot of administrator-heavy areas of the project, and is very thoughtful and patient when it comes to dealing with newcomers who don't understand Wikipedia's processes quite yet. We need more administrators with these traits, and we need more highly active admins. That said, I feel it would be against Neuro's wishes for somebody to not be honest and forth-right with him, and I will not lie; I have at times been concerned by Neuro's handling of certain situations. There are times when Neuro makes judgmental mistakes (and he knows this, he's not afraid of owning up to his mistakes), and on occasion I find he is a tad too willing to give obviously bad-faith editors more chances than they should have.

Various people tried to tell him that revert warring with admin rollback and then protecting the article on his preferred version and threatening to block users he'd just been edit warring against is really not appropriate. As Dmcdevit said at the time: ""This isn't something we can agree to disagree about; this is about sound administrative judgment, which, as long as you defend any of those actions, I must conclude that you lack"" and ""I am absolutely flabbergasted that you seem to see no difference between ""threatening to block people for incivility"" and threatening to block people you just reverted for incivility.

If you recognize your own bias on an issue, you should stay as far away from it in an official capacity as is possible.  If you can not recognize your own bias, you are not fit for the job.  If you can not set arrogance aside, you can not honor that responsibility.

"I think you're a great editor, and, should this request not succeed, you have an amazing amount of potential. You strike me as knowledgeable and intelligent, and I think you would make a good administrator. Unfortunately, the fact that you've only been around for three months concerns me. Three months isn't that long; I've been around for two years, and it seems like I've just begun! There are quite literally thousands of policies, guidelines, essays, how-to guides, noticeboards and discussion pages, and to be perfectly honest, I don't feel three months is enough time to become familiar with them and all their associated [[WP:TLA]]'s. As an administrator, you'll receive countless questions ranging from ""Why did you delete my article?"" to ""Do you know how to report a potential copyright violation"", so you'll need to know where to point people. I don't expect you (or anyone else) to memorize all policies; in fact, I encourage people to read them slowly and over a long period of time. But as I said, three months is simply not enough time to become familiar with all major aspects of the community. However, you seem capable of learning on the job, and that's what is keeping me from opposing. Regardless of whether this passes, I'd advise you to, at your own pace, read through [[WP:ARL]], and perhaps dabble in the various pages listed there.

Also, a prod2 which was blatantly removed, without discussion, by an IP 8 hours after being placed by Buckshot ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=...Va_man_dar_khoshbakhti-e_shirin_be_donya_amadam!&diff=238392563&oldid=238323998]) was never followed up.  I'm not suggesting that other people should use a watchlist in the same way that I do, but it seems reasonable to have watched this and followed it up (possibly with a re-instatement & a user warning?  Sending it to AfD so it's more visible?).  I am not convinced that a user ''should'' have used rollback before gaining its use as an admin, but I do note that Buckshot doesn't have rollback status or experience with undoing, reverting, warning users, etc.  And no speedy deletes?  Correct me if I'm wrong, of course, there are only so many contributions I can search through, lol :)  A few more thoughts: I don't see ''that'' many indications of how Buckshot handles himself under fire.  I've seen that a fair proportion of his edits, even from a month ago, are still the latest edits on the articles.  Not to be dismissive, but it would appear that he has been working largely in an area where there is not so much conflict and activity as to warrant quick responses.  Also, I fully accept that he has had documented trouble with user Mrg3105 and I do not know the nature of those problems, but a few days after Mrg3105 created an article, Buckshot added an <nowiki>{{accuracy}}</nowiki> tag with the edit summary ""this guy is smoking some serious weed"" ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Royal_Navy_stations&diff=next&oldid=235251796]).

"While Choess is an excellent editor, who makes a ton of menial edits (possibly via tools?) I had a real problem finding any proof of consensus building and/or policy understanding.  Of his over 23,000 edits, over 20,000 are in the mainspace and would be deemed minor (but beneficial) edits. While 3000 non-mainspace edits is still an impressive total so I tried to dig into them.  During the last 5 month period, he has made 3 edits to Wikipedia Talk.  One of those [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_UK_Parliament_constituencies#Splitting_constituencies_for_UK.2FGB_Parliaments|edits]] he started the discussion, but never participated or followed up on the discussion.  Another [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Succession_Box_Standardization#Proposal:_modifications_to_Template:Succession_box|edit]] he made a drive by comment, but never appears to have revisited the discussion.  His [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Middle_Ages/Crusades_task_force#Holy_Leagues.3F|third edit]], the same thing.  All three of those discussions encountered extensive discussion after his contribution, but he didn't appear to be involved in them.  I got the definite sense that he is the type to make drive by contributions.  So I looked at the other places where he might be involved with.  During the same 5 months, he's made 100 edits to the talk space.  While there is minimal evidence of working on GA reviews, most are cosmetic edits such as redirects, name changes, or adding appropriate project tags.  I don't think there are but one or two where he made more than 5 edits!  In fact, in his 3.5 years of editing there is only one article where he has contributed to the talk page more than 10 times.  Similarly, in the past 5 months, he's only made about 100 edits to User Talk pages.  While there are a few people he communicates with on a semi-regular basis, his user talk contributions are sporatic and do not show consensus building nor do they demand policy knowledge.  So how about his participation ot the wikipedia space?  Once again, during the past 5 months, he's only made about 50 edits to the wikipedia space.  The contributions to these spaces indicate drive by participation in a number of areas as compared to establishing oneself and obtaining a solid understanding of any one area.  Thus, while he is a solid editor, I don't see the policy building or a demonstration of communicative skills I'd like to see from admins candidates.  I'm also worried about the apparent drive by nature of his communication style.  On a side note, I would suggest responding to discussions on the page where they begin, it really makes researching discussions a lot easier.---'''",0.12413793103448274,0.46982758620689646

Some of your talkpage/Wikipedia page editing (which will become a large part of what you do as a result of ""admin actions""), are perhaps a bit ""short"", but they are sound in their policy interpretation.  I think there might be a language barrier of sorts?  My apologies for being assumptive, but it seems like you are not a native English speaker (I had to read your answer to Q1 above like 8 times to understand what you meant by ''Although I can still contribute greatly to the project by simply tagging speedy-eligible pages and notifying page creators, and reverting vandals and giving warnings to users and IPs, I sometimes can’t control my zeal protecting pages and blocking users and IPs myself, so I though it would be prolific if I have access to some tools that ordinary users can’t'').  A couple of things:  ""Zeal"" has a negative connotation and comes across as if you would be ""zealous"" in blocking others (blocking is a last resort in most cases and comes ''after'' open dialogue is at least attempted, not a block first and ask questions later thing.  Same with protecting.  Same with assuming all IPs are vandals).  Calling non-admins ""ordinary users"" also has a negative ''us vs. them'' connotation, but again, I don't think you meant it that way.  I think you'll do fine with the extra buttons, and you work in an area of the wiki that does seem to attract vandalistic editing where you would be an asset to the project.  If in doubt, ask someone you trust first before performing a controversial admin action, I believe you'll do just fine.  Cheers,",0.1349753694581281,0.4157909140667761

Further, I admitted to what could be viewed as ""canvassing"" by notifying both users Bob the Tomato (vanished) and Rklawton (on wikibreak) of her RfA process. Candidate's defensive manner in answering my (perhaps) leading questions might have contributed to a somewhat negative impression conveyed to those reading the process.

Those familiar with Jeffrey O. Gustafson know about his ... eccentricities... but to question an admin's sanity for enforcing policy is a bit much.  Then Rodhullandemu had the gall to, after noting Jeffrey's failings (a rather troll-like move, IMO), [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffrey_O._Gustafson&diff=prev&oldid=164432964 question Jeffrey's commitment to the project] (something Jeffrey believed in vehemently and devoted much of his time to) by saying ""''I've created several pages from scratch. I've taken several pages from sows' ears towards silk purses in the few days since I joined the Wikification project. I don't see you doing that. Again, nothing personal, but exactly why are you here?""'' (Which, of course, is not just insulting but ignores his many many contributions, including featured content.) Rodhullandemu then flipped out, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rodhullandemu&diff=prev&oldid=164436612 stormed off] in a huff claiming he was going to be dead soon and that the removal of the fair use images from his userspace meant that no-one would have any clue who he was.  Lovely.  Veiled personal attacks in retaliation of policy enforcement, even against a certain controversial admin few had love for, followed by dramatic overreaction is just not acceptable to me (but maybe I am a little biased).   --",0.07575396825396824,0.40710317460317463

"I worry about this user's clue. For a while Rudget was a clerk at the rename board. While he did primarily good work, several of his comments were not helpful or wrong and indicated a lack of understanding of the rename process; he was contacted about this by three different people before he left a [[Wikipedia talk:Changing username/Assistance#Clerk Resignation|resignation note]]. When clerking at the rename board, it is important that the bureaucrats can trust that a clerk's comments are correct and relevant, otherwise the bureaucrats must check everything themselves, which defeats the purpose of having clerks. He volunteered his time at a place where it's important one understand what's going on, but he didn't fully. {{tlx|Rudget notice to readers}} should not have been in template space, (I pointed this out to him and he then userfied) which I also find alludes to a larger lack of wiki knowhow. A while back he closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of destinations served by Manchester Airport Terminal 1|these]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of destinations served by Manchester Airport Terminal 2|two]] AfDs as keep after commenting keep in them (they were ultimately relisted after a DRV and deleted). He says he didn't know that this was a procedural faux pas, and while that was almost certainly true, abstaining from closing discussions one has commented on is a huge deal in my mind, and the fact that he didn't know even that important aspect of the deletion process causes me to question the thoroughness of his policy knowledge. A similar problem was also exhibited on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRNY (AM)|these]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRRC (FM)|two]], which were also [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 November 18|overturned at DRV]], although I can't find a relisting of them anywhere interestingly. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Usernames_for_administrator_attention&diff=next&oldid=182136252 He reported] a username at UAA (which means it is blatant and needs to be blocked right now), but quickly changed his mind after feedback from EVula. While it's good that he was able to understand he was wrong, if someone is going to report a user to be blocked quickly because of his username, he should be sure that his report is correct. His last RfA was also a bit over two months ago, and while waiting three months is not a steadfast rule, I appreciate when an editor can respect the community's norms; this isn't a huge deal though. Ever since being appointed to featured portal co-director, he has not given up a chance to make note of it (cf. Q2 and userpage). This seems to me as if he sees that this appointment (and therefore it is not unreasonable to assume he sees adminship this way) as a trophy. I'm also really confused about the answer to Q3 [[User:Rudget/AC#Round two|here]]. I assume that was written incorrectly; otherwise I think he may need to scale back his time here. [[User:Rudget/Contributions#Users I've helped to block|This]] is extremely distasteful, and my biggest concern. Blocking is not something we strive to do, and then wear a list of users we have gotten blocked as a badge of honor. Interestingly, at least one of those users has never been blocked before. It is these several lapses in judgment that, while none are particularly serious, (although I still cannot get over his ''Users I've helped to block'' list), that cause me enough concern about misuse (although not neccessarily ''abuse'') of the tools, as well as his attitude towards things if he were to become an admin.

"'''Neutral''': 13,000 edits in nine months, working four hours a day on nothing but Wikipedia, 7 days a week, works out to around four minutes spent on each edit.  That's an absurd pace of editing and not consistent with giving careful consideration to all viewpoints in article and meta discussions.  Even going to the extreme of saying half your edits were vandalism reversions requiring only 30 seconds of your attention, at two hours a day, seven days a week, you're still only spending 4.5 minutes per edit, dropping to as little as 2.4 minutes in September of last year.

He is civil, respectful, and helpful, to new users, and indeed, to anyone who is here to build an encyclopedia. VanTucky is here to build an encyclopedia, and the admin tools will make that easier for him. That's what we should be doing—sysopping people who will use the tools to better the encyclopedia, not to better their rank, or to eliminate those they don't like, or whatever.

"Sorry, but the concerns from last time, especially the empty record on article writing or building, has still not been alleviated. It is not necessary to be a prolific writer of featured articles, but there should normally be some experience with locating sources, deciding what is good research, bad research and original research and so on. Administrating an encyclopedia requires some skills in building an encyclopedia. In addition, contributions to *FD, policy page discussions, and so on are also lacking (though none of these are essential by itself). Policing the encyclopedia is something the candidate does well, and he has by no means done anything wrong in doing so, but the administrator tools of ""delete"" and ""protect"" are pretty powerful and they cause unintended consequences in the hands of someone without a hands-on experience with articles beyond reverting vandalism.",0.03392857142857144,0.7309523809523809

This meads me to think that he will have problems as an administrator - civility and maturity are paramount. Also, the excessive socializing worries me.

"His editing experience is the narrowest I've seen. Minimal experience with vandalism, and he seems a bit confused when discussing it: ""I have occasionally needed to post to [[WP:3RR]] or [[WP:ANI]] because of continued vandalism"" does not inspire confidence at all. Says he is interested in closing AFDs, but he has participated in roughly a dozen of them, all of which I perused. I'm not going to comment on the merits of the articles being discussed, because I have no idea what they looked like at the time, and frankly I don't care, but will say I was not very impressed with his understanding of deletion policy. Specifically, he says ""merge and delete"" several times [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Immigration_%28CA%29&diff=103148138&oldid=102988664] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Proof_of_mathematical_induction&diff=65638626&oldid=65626628] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Regular_number&diff=62583942&oldid=62581099], but that is not permitted as the [[GFDL]] requires us to preserve edit history for all content we use. More broadly, he also has a backward view regarding policies and guidelines. I'm slightly appalled when he says ''""Lack of sources is not an AFD criteria""'' and ''""It is only notability that I think is the issue here.""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Emma%27s_Dilemma&diff=prev&oldid=99189798]. Verifiability is absolute policy. Notability is a subjective guideline, one which is vulnerable to systemic bias on all sides. I worry that he will delete valid, verifiable content because it doesn't meet the Wikipedia:Notability (whatever) guideline he feels most closely applies, as he suggests at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Decemyriagon&diff=prev&oldid=101842209].

Learning and becoming a part of the culture is a good quality.

You must demonstrate a serious attitude in order to have the extra tools. You might be a serious person, but your answers were answered poorly and without much thought. The RfA is a serious deal. Adminship is not something that Wikipedia throws away to everyone. Spend 5-6 more months on the English Wikipedia, make a lot of useful edits (just don't get editcountis), read over the admin reading, get some admin coaching, take some virtual classroom classes, and we'll see from there.

I also feel that your editing seems to be centered around the Olympics, as almost all of your top edited articles are Olympics related. I'd like to see a ''bit'' more variety and breadth, it's good to wander off to different areas of the project now and again. I'm also concerned because I don't feel you have many contributions to AfD. Since you express an interest in closing deletion debates, I'd like to see a fair amount of contribution to AfD discussion.

"I don't feel as though Karrmann is well-suited for admin buttons at this time.  I believe he lacks the necessary judicious nature and levelheadedness to effectively deal with ''keeping Wikipedia's integrity safe from vandals and other nonsense'', to quote the candidate himself (see his answer to the first question for more context).  He often jumps the gun a bit when reverting and warning other users.  For example, [[User_talk:Gaillimh/Archive_3#actually|this conversation]] illustrates my point.  This is actually my only direct encounter with the candidate; I'm not sure if this is entirely relevant, but it might be worth noting.  You'll see in this conversation that he maintains that he reverts a user manually, although his edit summary clearly shows that he is using an automated tool called ""TW"" (Twinkle).  He admits being ""protective"" of a user, and this apparently clouded the fellow's judgment.  However, he did not remove the inappropriate warnings he left for the user following our discussion, which leads me to believe that he doesn't care that much about rectifying his errors or antagonising newcomers to the project.  In addition, [[User_talk:Cyde/Archive017#User_talk:_Phaedriel|this discussion]] further shows his propensity for misinterpretation and biting others.  It seems that he and his conversation partner were able to amicably resolve things, which is quite nice, however, his first two posts are highly inappropriate and a bit ridiculous.  While he appears to be a nice enough fellow and a good article writer (specifically in the field of autos), he lacks the fundamental social graces and common sense one would want someone using the block function to have.  Referring to administrators as having powers is also concerning, as first mentioned by Pedro; this sort of rhetoric can create a divisive nature among the community and is a mindset that  completely goes against what Wikipedia is and is supposed to be.

In late January 2007, I foolishly decided to improve a contentious article, [[Wikipedia]], inspired by my research on the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  After a week's worth of work/research and 227 edits on my part — more than I've devoted to most of my [[WP:FA|Featured Articles]] — Mr. Cunningham appeared out of nowhere and took a meat cleaver to my work.  Over the next three days, he worked efficiently and [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] to remove most of my contributions without giving cogent reasons or asking me why I had added them.  Up to that time, I had been spoiled by my wonderful interactions with more collaborative Wikipedians (indeed, I'd just been collaborating with [[User:Gurch|Gurch]] — then calling himself [[User:Qxz|Qxz]] — on [[Wikipedia]]) and I was shocked and dismayed that all my work was in vain.  Part of that dismay is certainly my own failing; we all have to allow that our work can be edited mercilessly, even destroyed without Talking.  I'm sure that I liked my work too well and I hadn't then given enough thought to how to deal with situations like that; perhaps if I'd been more patient and skillful, we could've been reached some mutually agreeable consensus.  But consensus seemed impossible with Mr. Cunningham; he left me with the fullest belief that he could not imagine that any vision except his own was worth considering.  I do believe firmly that [[User:Thumperward|Thumperward]] was and is well-intentioned toward Wikipedia; however, my impression is that he has not yet learned to work well with others and I question whether he can be trusted with the tools.",0.12318840579710144,0.5777777777777777

(I remember that I called him and another user two rare instances of sensible Wikipedians from Kerala on his talk page prior to that.) However, since then, I have noted that this user is unduly patronising towards new users. His book-kissing and immature interpretation of policies is often annoying. The articles he prepared single-handedly resemble school book assignments rather than encylopedic articles, ([[Mahé River]] for example), although they are far better than most of the stupid articles related to Kerala like this stupid scatty piece like [[Mamankam]]. And I strongly doubt he has some petty biases from an edit summary he inserted for his revert of [[Malayala Manorama]] on October 16. The first thing he should do after election (a foregone conclusion), I believe, is to delete a few silly articles or stubs he created, like [[Kochi City Police]],[[Toc-H Public School]], [[School of Communication and Management Studies]] etc. But for my pleasure of cooking the goose of a unanimous election, I should have placed these remarks under comments section and abstained from opposing.",-0.05178253119429589,0.5309046345811052

"I need persuasion. This is still less than the fairly-bright line of 3 months and an editor who withdrew once because of being too soon should really be making sure that their renomination is clear of that kind of problem. Then I discovered, from last week, [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Naconkantari 2]] which the editor declined as being too soon. What changed in the last few days? Also, looking through the last 1500 edits I see almost no encyclopedia-writing. Racking up 15,000 edits isn't so hard when they're handed to you by the IRC bots, although reverting vandalism is obviously an important part of holding the Project in good shape. Being a vandal-whacker is not a qualification for adminship. The edits to Wikipedia: space are largely AfD and RfA with a few reverts, and I can't find much in places like AN or AN/I or debating zones to adequately judge things on. Some good examples would be nice. Given the preponderance of vandalism warnings, I'd also like to see two or three examples of good conversation engagement either on Talk: or User talk:. -",0.23101503759398495,0.42855054302422724

I have been through your article contributions and associated user Talk contributions from your first edit to December 2005 and compared the vandal reverts that I have found with the associated editors' Talk pages.  The difs are located [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Olessi&oldid=82852249 on this RfA's Talk page].  I will happily change my opinion if evidence can be provided that vandal warnings have been issused for associated reverts in the last ten months.  Reverting vandalism is an important part of any editor's job.  Warning vandals is important for the community in order to know when someone is either a persistent pest or a one-off.  If warnings are missed out on then a vandal can continue for so much longer, where they could have been stopped earlier if the warnings had accumulated.  This is the only thing that I would request to change about your editing style; in all other respects that I have studied you are an exemplary Wikipedian.",0.23863636363636365,0.5522727272727272

"Phaedriel is obviously an extraordinary editor and person and that is actually why I am opposing. I do not doubt her competence or trustworthiness at all (I'd be crazy to), but I do wonder how becoming an admin will compromise those traits that have made her, rightfully, the only Wikipedian that has her own fan club. The fact that she is using a reduced version of her lovely signature on this page (so as not to disturb the signature police, maybe?) somewhat worries me in this regard. Phaedriel has demonstrated herself as being capable of so much, both from an editing standpoint with her portals and wikiproject she has started, to her incredible interpersonal skills. I just think, with all that, why bog her down with the tedious and menial tasks of adminship that will occupy her attention and divert her from the truly great things she can offer the project? I really believe that if a user like Phaedriel is going to contribute to the ""greater good"" here at Wikipedia, it's not going to have much to do with her protecting pages, deleting vanity pages, and applying blocks to vandals -- she has advanced far beyond that. Furthermore half of ""adminship"" is really about the elevated status you receive. Phaedriel, as an ordinary editor, has achieved a level of community acceptance and respect that far surpasses what the ""admin"" label affords, so it's not as though the passing of this RfA will change anything in that regard. Besides, it's always really nice, especially as a non-admin and probably for new users as well, to see that a non-admin can carry just the same ""weight"" around here (if not more) that an admin does. Finally, before I get a barrage of angry comments, obviously this preceding comment is made with the full recognition that this RfA will pass by a record-setting landslide and my intention is not to hinder that with this vote  - just adding my two cents as the process permits and encourages. — ''",0.15773358585858585,0.6323469065656565

Comments about RFA don't inspire confidence either (although I agree te process could be better) ""voting for the wrong reason"" which perhaps not what was meant but comes across as voting for a different reason (and presumably a different way) to me is ""the wrong reason"". --",0.1111111111111111,0.6126543209876543

Not informing vandals that they have had their efforts reverted is harming their efforts to be good contributors and other editors/admins efforts to stop persistent vandalism.  Other than that, I see that you participate in XfD discussions, which is good, but difs such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Glifted&diff=prev&oldid=63231605], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mechanist&diff=prev&oldid=63761508], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rodney_Ascher&diff=prev&oldid=60150100], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rodney_Ascher&diff=prev&oldid=60150147] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Soul_Calibur_IV&diff=prev&oldid=20777671] don't refer to policies and guidelines such as [[WP:BIO]], [[WP:NOT]] and [[WP:SOFTWARE]].

However, I also share concern about the sentiments they have expressed about the [[WP:AGF]] policy. I believe AGF is a cornerstone of the Wiki Community and a mindset that is of vital need for an Administrator. Good faith should be assumed on a level that is tantamount to the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" level that we hold guilt in society. A user needs to definitively demonstrate they are acting in bad faith and I think far too often the ""Bad Faith"" label is bandied about with newbies or more shy introverted users who do not ""talk"" as much as others in order to ""positively prove their ''good faith''"". Good Faith shouldn't hold the burden of evidence and I think that is where I most disagree with the candidate. The AGF policy serves as an internal checks and balance for civil discourse and it should be a looking glass that every admin views through--especially when the consideration of deleting articles or banning users is being made.

Assuming arguendo that the nomination is sincerely essayed, though, I'd suggest that, even as the user may be eminently qualified for adminship (as, for example, a pensive and civil contributor well acquainted with extant guidelines such that he would be unlikely to abuse or, through ignorance, misuse the admin tools), the body of his contributions simply doesn't provide one enough of a history from which to apprehend judgment, but that, as others have suggested, should his quality work continue, it's most probable that an RfA in six to twelve weeks should succeed.",0.2525,0.5032142857142857

As mentioned above, 400 article edits, the vast majority of which are vandal reverts and spelling corrections, doesn't allow you to demonstrate your abilities to contribute encyclopedic content and communicate effectively.  An admin needs to be able to perform both of those tasks to a high ability in order to interact with other editors and assist them in their article-building efforts.  In order to build up more experience in these matters, I suggest joining projects such as the Featured Article and Good article drives.  These will allow you to express your opinions from the point-of-view of policies and guidelines and also to develop your research and encyclopedic writing abilities at the same time.  I would further suggest assisting new editors at the Help and Reference Desks in order to become familiar with the range of resources available to Wikipedia and the different experience levels of editors - postgrad/doctoral/faculty to high school - and effective means of communication for each.  You can also patrol the new and recent changes pages in order to revert vandals, warn them and finally report them to [[WP:AIV]] or other appropriate place.

Also, replies to answers have been basically the same since his second nomination, even though they are outdated by now (the candidate claims ''Additionally, I have seen quitte a number occasions when someone (including me) reports a 3RR violation or a vandalizing annon; and it takes quitte a lot of time for the admins to react.''; however I could not find a report in [[WP:AIV]] nor [[WP:AN3]] from the user since March).

The current nominator says that the previous nomination failed because it ""had to be restarted"" - I find it hard to believe that it failed for mere procedural reasons; rather, it seems apparent that it failed because there were a whole bunch of discontents. It seems reasonable to try to figure out what the hell happened to the 49 people and their negative opinions.

Perhaps it was simply ignorance of the case, in any case, I'd like to hear a response.

This apears to me to be both misinformed (we've always had problems with banned users not giving up: Wik, Zephram Stark, Jason Gastrich, Bonaparte, etc.) and an unsettling comment nonetheless, since we desperately ''want'' banned users to go away; I can't think of a less subtle hint.

"'''Neutral''' at this time. It looks like you're heading in the right direction. From Interiot, I see that the majority of your contributions have come in February and March, so while you technically have three months, your first month or so was not very active. Personally I like to see at least three months of activity, so to me you're ''almost'' at that threshold. I'm not as concerned about your ''quantity'' of Mainspace edits because it looks like the majority of your edits are in the Mainspace, so I feel like that's simply a matter of time if you keep going. I also feel that your editing seems to be centered around the Olympics, as almost all of your top edited articles are Olympics related. I'd like to see a ''bit'' more variety and breadth, it's good to wander off to different areas of the project now and again. I'm also concerned because I don't feel you have many contributions to AfD. Since you express an interest in closing deletion debates, I'd like to see a fair amount of contribution to AfD discussion. I think in general, you show great signs, and are moving in the right direction, but I feel you could use a little more time before Adminship.

"'''Strongly'''. I came here in the process of looking at the contribs of the first nominator who is a new user with suspicious behavior; neither nominator is reliable for evaluating admin qualifications ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=250&target=King_Toadsworth], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&target=Randfan]). Evaluating [[User:Llama man]]'s qualifications independently of that, there are almost no Wikipedia talk edits—the only non-revert or non-trivial such edit is to report a personal attack on [[WT:NPA]] in August; the greatest number of his ""over 400"" Wikipedia-space edits are to the Sandbox and various sandbox games—the latest being a BJAODN, most of the AfD comments are in the last two weeks and many in total were empty votes duplicating what others said. There are an absurdly high number of user talk edits and edits to his own user page. The answer to question 1 seems to come right out of the administrator's handbook (read: ""admins can block and unblock users"", check; ""admins can edit protected pages"", check; ""admins deal with administrator backlogs"", check; ""admins deal with AIV"", check; speedy deletion, RFP, AFD, check, check, check); the diffs provided in answer to question 2 of what contributions he is ""most pleased"" with are minor edits; his ""100+"" edits (awesome edit count) to [[Mario]] are a lot of vandal reversions. There are many legitimate fix-up edits and ref additions to this article, but aside from [[Llama]] this appears to be almost the only article he has any non-minor contributions to; half of the few Talk edits[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=100&target=Llama_man&namespace=1] are vandal reversions and the rest are almost all [[Mario]]. That is, the one article he mentions he is ""pleased"" with is roughly the only article he edits. Considering that most edits to the main namespace are vandalism reverts and nearly all of the many edits to the user talk namespace are vandalism warnings, and in light of the answers to the questions above, this user's involvement and experience with Wikipedia is not sufficient for understanding Wikipedia policy or the activities of an administrator. Vandalism reverting is helpful, but does not demonstrate the understanding, cool-headedness, or trustworthiness necessary.

"'''Neutral''' You are a good editor and I think that you will make a fine admin in time, just not this time.  Two deal-breakers for me are only twenty-five Wikispace edits with less than ten being to XfD discussions, and no vandal warnings present in your user Talk edits.  There is also the case of a distinct lack of edit summaries, so you should force the use of edit summaries in your preferences to prevent this in future.  If you were to open an [[Wikipedia:editor review|editor review]], I would offer the following comments; get involved with patrolling the new and recent changes pages - you will learn to recognise vandalism and how to revert it, warn vandals and report them to [[WP:AIV]] when they persist; participate in XfD discussions - you can use your comments to demonstrate a knowledge of Wikipedia policies and procedures; continue to interact with editors in Wikiprojects such as Esperanza mentioned above; assist new users at the Help and Reference Desk pages and lastly, keep editing articles with an eye to supplying verified and well-sourced information.  Keep doing and or all of the above and you will be a fine recruit to the admin ranks.  Lastly, I suggest withdrawing this RfA with no loss of face.

You post information on who you are on your user page. Would you be comfortable with crackpots harassing your school because you deleted an article on their fringe theory? Would you be willing to deal with users who insist that quantum mechanics/relativity/conservation of energy is wrong, and that their theory should be included as a legitimate theory? Crackpots in physics fields hardly ever comprimise. Also, as another note, you should read [[WP:SOCK]], since you state that you would block an experienced user for sock puppetry.

You have about 1700 edits, and a cursory look at the most recent ones seems to indicate that they were minor tweaks to the same few articles.  In this same cursory look, I couldn’t find many instances of the vandal-fighting you say that you want the admin tools for.  However – a few positives – your edit summary usages have much improved since your previous RfAs, and your edits are nicely distributed.  I would suggest waiting a good 6 months before you try this again – and in that time, edit more frequently and do more vandal-fighting.  It would help to get someone else to nominate you for adminship, as well.

I am concerned about this user's handling of images. In particular, he has uploaded a large quantity of images that apparently come from http://www.kawaiidream.net/. On that page, it says ""Images belong to their owners...Personal use only. Pictures publishing on other websites is forbidden without consentement"".

Thus, we can't verify the source. I question that these images qualify as promotional, and doubt the tag properly applies given the copyright notice on the bottom of that site's page. Further, images such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Normal_HeatGuts.jpg], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Basara-portrait.jpg], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Style_custom.jpg] uploaded by this user have no source identified with them.

Given the image tagging problems, I'm voting neutral on this one. I would '''''strongly''''' encourage him to go back and review his image contributions ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&offset=0&limit=50&target=MegamanZero&namespace=6]) and fix the licensing and source attributions. --",0.14148351648351648,0.4707875457875458

This is particularly true given the fact that this is coupled with dealing with vandals: but with so few article edits, this is clearly something he does not do. Clearly, all admins are charged with enforcing the Committee's decisions, but few of them actually walk around ''looking'' for opportunities to club people over the head with the rulings. I was interested to see that he has, in Q3, ''""dealt with several previous disputes by filing Requests for Arbitration""'' — going to ArbCom is a statement that the dispute ''has not'' been dealt with, and this should not be a first reaction to a dispute. Also in Q3, admins ''are'' empowered to decide who is a troll and a bully but it is left primarily to ArbCom to decide on the cases where this is not clear-cut.

"'''Neutral''' I have never participated in a Request for Adminship discussion before, and I'm not sure exactly what the requirements for Adminship should be, so I won't be voting.  However, I have myself observed what I found to be a potential problem with Ryulong.  See [[User_talk:Cute_1_4_u#A_note]].  His introductory note, suggesting that Cute_1_4_u essentially leave wikipedia, I find to be unacceptable.  Then, when she defended herself, stating that she was improving wikipedia and that she writes multiple articles every day, he responded with ""Whether or not you create those articles doesn't mean you are improving the Encyclopedia. Those articles can be about nonsense, or they can be serious. You can write an article about a cookie you are eating or you can start an article about something that has just appeared on a national news program. Creating articles and edit counts are not important. You should focus on quality over quantity"".  Now, I understand that Cute_1_4_u has been misbehaving, shall we say, she's repeatedly posted copywritten text from other websites, even after being told not to.  On the other hand, she's only 11 years old, and she has created a number of non-plagiarized articles, as well as many hundreds of decent edits to articles, so she is not a vandal, just a kid who needs to be watched over.  Suggesting that she leave wikipedia, or that her articles aren't high enough quality, are both inappropriate and counterproductive.  My concern is that Ryulong, having spent so much time in vandal fighting, has taken on too harsh of an attitude towards those who might be breaking the rules.  Having said all this, though, he's obviously overall an asset to wikipedia, and administrator or not, wikipedia is better off thanks to his work.  --",0.019583333333333338,0.48407828282828275

"'''Neutral''' If you want to know what it takes to be an admin, please read [[Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide]], [[Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrators]].  If you chew through that lot and still decide that you want the additional responsibilities, you can then place yourself on [[Wikipedia:Editor review|editor review]] in order to find out which areas of editing and administration you need to sharpen up in order to put another RfA together. You can be a superb vandalfighter without having the admin tools using tools such as Vandalproof and CryptoDerek's vandalfigher, amongst others.  Good things to do in order to become an admin are to participate in XfD discussions.  Your participation should ideally take the form of contributions using policy and guidelines for their justification rather than pile-on '''keep''' or '''delete''', etc.  By this we will know that you are familiar with the policies and how they are applied in equivocal situations.  We can face these situations several times a day, depending upon how active we are.  You can also participate in new user/new page/recent change patrols, reverting vandalism and warning vandals in addition to flagging them up to [[WP:AIV]] or other appropriate noticeboard.  Don't forget that you can also contribute to articles - after all, that's why we're all here, isn't it?  Useful things to contribute are sourcing references, cleaning up NPOV statements, grammar, syntax and spelling if your English skills are up to it, categorising and expanding stubs.  You can also participate in the Featured Articles and Good Articles programmes too - I don't mean writing one from scratch!

I don't mean to single The Transhumanist out; this is, unfortunately, a widespread idea, and it's harmful to the encyclopedia.

I also have some concerns about his ability to accept and respond to criticism, which is a fairly regular consequence of using admin tools. The recent Esperanza MfD and related discussions haven't assuaged that concern, I'm afraid.

"Leaning in the direction of opposition.  FM has made (and, I hope, will continue to make) positive contributions here.  However, FM's aggressive style of discussion has, in my opinion, in more than one important case been a pretty severe breach of civility.  I don't have much faith that FM would be able, as an admin, to control his anger at users who have displeased him in the past.  I know FM won't take this well (since, as far as I can tell, he is still upset at me for an incident occurring last fall), but I have to be honest about what I see.  In FM I see an editor who can and does make positive contributions here, but I do not see the necessary care in judgment, the willingness to dialogue openly, and the respect for this site's civility policy that I think of as core to the position of admin.

Minghong then did a massive ""cleanup"" (as he told it) by deleting all descriptions and replacing entries with internal links to (nearly) all non-existing articles for the programs. He did this without any prior discussion on the talk page. This created quite some pressure to start new articles for each and every program, which in turn are now accused being plain advertisement articles. He also quickly and boldly reverted my edit (adding external named links) without any attempt to discuss it or to consider my argumentation or presenting arguments himself. The list itself now has no info besides the names of the programs (in the form of internal links to mostly non-existing articles) and some unnamed external links (which are deemed very bad style according to [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]]) - but he only tolerates these on entries for which no article exists.

"Based on my recent experience with Hawstom mediating an [[User_talk:Rednblu#Allegations_against_User:Rednblu|dispute]] over a user's alleged POV campaigning in bad faith, I can not recommend Hawstom as an Admin. Though I do not doubt his initial intention to remain objective, in the mediation he publicly slipped a number of times in being overly deferential to one party and made several explicit and implied statements favoring one party in the mediation, both on User talk pages and by email. His NPOV in the dispute was far from complete/optimal. Hawstom also was unaware of the wikipolicy on [[Wikipedia:Refactoring#When_to_refactor|Refactoring]], a policy central to the allegations, and only became aware of it when I pointed it out. His method for resolving the dispute was lengthy, inefficient and did not produce tangible results. Questionable tactics employed by one party in the mediation went unchecked by Hawstom, as did a number of ad hominems. Additionally, Hawstom failed to respond/reply to my 5 emails sent in reply to his contacting me. When asked about this, he promised to respond to them but still has not. In defense of Hawstom he had a prior friendly working relationship with the defendant, so remaining genuinely neutral would have been a real struggle for anyone. But that also causes me to wonder why Hawstom initiated the mediation (I did not seek it), and that he mediate it, in the first place.--",-0.01184210526315788,0.37456140350877193

It doesn't help that Jor votes here suddenly, although he hasn't edited articles since April (when his RfA failed, and at the very same time Anárion started editing - '''Jor's last article edit (apart from three isolated ones in May) took place on April 23, ''two hours'' before Anárion's first-ever edit''' - coincidence?). Also, Jor's user page makes it clear that he is still editing under another name - if that other name isn't Anárion, maybe Jor could tell us what it is. This again is, given the lack of de-sysopping procedures, too much of a risk. It is also interesting that Anárion made about half his edits in the last week only, and they're almost all de-facto minor edits, though not always marked as such. As to Jor, he clearly holds Nazi-sympathetic views like this expressed on [[Talk:Erika Steinbach]]: ""A peace treaty was made impossible because Poland's allies immediately declared war on Nazi Germany, and it is rather pointless to speculate what might have been had England not taken the invasion of Poland as an excuse to declare war on their economic rival.""",-0.032017543859649125,0.3765350877192983

"I wasn't going to vote on this matter, but Neutrality's conduct on this page worries me greatly.  All of us encounter opposition to our views, some if it from users who many find turbulent.  The views of all non-banned, non-sock puppet users count equally, and Neutrality's belief that common sense dictates against counting Rex071404's vote doesn't square well either with policy or my sense of fair play. I've had my run-ins with VV myself, but VV's opinion counts too, whether or not VV has a ""grudge"" against anyone. It appears that Neutrality is intent on having the last word with his/her critics, which often isn't the best strategy toward ensuring long-term wikipeace. Lastly, it's important that the record of discussions such as this be as accurate as possible, and even subtle changes such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=5230097&oldid=5230021 this edit] make me uncomfortable (I'm fine with strikeouts, however).  --",0.20555555555555555,0.5933333333333334
